# Mini-Project
This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python mini projects I built while learning Python. Each project focuses on simple logic, user input handling, and control flow to reinforce core programming concepts.

üìÅ Projects
1. Mad Libs Game
A fun word game that asks the user to input different parts of speech (adjectives, nouns, verbs) to generate a silly and creative story.

2. Calculator App
A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user selects an operation and inputs two numbers, and the program displays the result.

3. Driving Eligibility and Traffic Exam
This script checks whether a user is old enough to take a driving exam and then quizzes them with a few basic traffic rule questions.

4. Weight Converter
A simple converter that lets users convert their weight between kilograms and pounds.

5. Compound Interest Calculator
A Python program that calculates compound interest, validating user inputs for principal, rate, and time to ensure they are positive values before computing and displaying the final amount.
