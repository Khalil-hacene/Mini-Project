# Mini-Project
This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python mini projects I built while learning Python. Each project focuses on simple logic, user input handling, and control flow to reinforce core programming concepts.

üìÅ Projects
1. Mad Libs Game
A fun word game that asks the user to input different parts of speech (adjectives, nouns, verbs) to generate a silly and creative story.

2. Calculator App
A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, etc. The user selects an operation and inputs two numbers, and the program displays the result.

3. Driving Eligibility and Traffic Exam
This script checks whether a user is old enough to take a driving exam and then quizzes them with a few basic traffic rule questions.

4. Weight Converter
A simple converter that lets users convert their weight between kilograms and pounds.

5. Compound Interest Calculator
A Python program that calculates compound interest, validating user inputs for principal, rate, and time to ensure they are positive values before computing and displaying the final amount.

6. Shopping Cart Program
A simple Python program that lets users add food items and their prices to a virtual cart, then displays the items and calculates the total cost. The user can quit anytime by entering 'q'.

7. Concession Stand Program:
A simple menu system for selecting food items and calculating the total cost. Users can add items to their cart and see the final price.

8. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:
A player vs. computer game where choices determine the winner. Supports replayability with a "play again" option.

9. Number Guessing Game:
A guessing game where players try to find a random number within a range, receiving hints (too high/low) after each attempt.
